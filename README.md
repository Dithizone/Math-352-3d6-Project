# Math-352-3d6-Project
This is the repository for the CSUCI Math 352 final 
project, doing a sequence of Monte Carlo simulations 
to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers.

The simulated dice roll data is located in ```data/dice runs```
and was generated by ```DiceDataGenerator.py```. It will be
converted into pretty and meaningful graphs by ```DiceDataAnalysis.py```
before being displayed elegantly in a jupyter notebook
which has not yet been created.
