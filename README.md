# Math-352-3d6-Project
This is the repository for the (completed!) CSUCI Math 352
Spring 2020 final project, doing a sequence of Monte Carlo
simulations to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers.

The simulated dice roll data is located in ```data/dice runs```
and was generated by ```DiceDataGenerator.py```. See ```3d6VarianceProject.ipynb```
for the all the graphs used in the final paper.
